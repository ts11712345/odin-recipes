This project didn't come out very pretty with using only basic HTML, but it was quite effective in hammering the git commands. 
I'm now somewhat comfortable with the git syntax, as well as add;commit -m; push.
It's almost reinforced cd commands and attention to where you are in the directory, as well as other commands such as DOCTYPE, headers, and list commands.
I was nervous at first and admittedly did spend 10 minutes staring at a blank page, but I'm glad the lesson panned out the way that it did. I finally feel comfortable with this portion.
